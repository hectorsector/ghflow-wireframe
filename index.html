          <h2>Create a branch</h2>

          <p>
            When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of
            different features or ideas in progress at any given time â€“ some of
            which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to
            help you manage this workflow.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an
            environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make on a
            branch don't affect the <code>main</code> branch, so you're free to
            experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your
            branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone
            you're collaborating with.
          </p>

          <h3>ProTip</h3>

          <p>
            Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub flow is
            based upon it. There's only one rule: anything in the
            <code>main</code> branch is always deployable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of this, it's extremely important that your new branch is
            created off of main when working on a feature or a fix. Your branch
            name should be descriptive (e.g.,
            <code>refactor-authentication</code>,
            <code>user-content-cache-key</code>,
            <code>make-retina-avatars</code>), so that others can see what is
            being worked on.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div
          class="panel-content js-panel-content js-panel-content-commits"
          data-step="commits"
        >
          <h2>Add commits</h2>

          <p>
            Once your branch has been created, it's time to start making
            changes. Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're making a
            commit, and adding them to your branch. This process of adding
            commits keeps track of your progress as you work on a feature
            branch.
          </p>

          <p>
            Commits also create a transparent history of your work that others
            can follow to understand what you've done and why. Each commit has
            an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why
            a particular change was made. Furthermore, each commit is considered
            a separate unit of change. This lets you roll back changes if a bug
            is found, or if you decide to head in a different direction.
          </p>

          <h3>ProTip</h3>

          <p>
            Commit messages are important, especially since Git tracks your
            changes and then displays them as commits once they're pushed to the
            server. By writing clear commit messages, you can make it easier for
            other people to follow along and provide feedback.
          </p>

        <div
          class="panel-content js-panel-content js-panel-content-pr"
          data-step="pr"
        >
          <h2>Open a Pull Request</h2>

          <p>
            Pull Requests initiate discussion about your commits. Because
            they're tightly integrated with the underlying Git repository,
            anyone can see exactly what changes would be merged if they accept
            your request.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can open a Pull Request at any point during the development
            process: when you have little or no code but want to share some
            screenshots or general ideas, when you're stuck and need help or
            advice, or when you're ready for someone to review your work. By
            using GitHub's @mention system in your Pull Request message, you can
            ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down
            the hall or ten time zones away.
          </p>

          <h3>ProTip</h3>

          <p>
            Pull Requests are useful for contributing to open source projects
            and for managing changes to shared repositories. If you're using a
            Fork &amp; Pull Model, Pull Requests provide a way to notify project
            maintainers about the changes you'd like them to consider. If you're
            using a Shared Repository Model, Pull Requests help start code
            review and conversation about proposed changes before they're merged
            into the main branch.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div
          class="panel-content js-panel-content js-panel-content-code-review"
          data-step="code-review"
        >
          <h2>Discuss and review your code</h2>

          <p>
            Once a Pull Request has been opened, the person or team reviewing
            your changes may have questions or comments. Perhaps the coding
            style doesn't match project guidelines, the change is missing unit
            tests, or maybe everything looks great and props are in order. Pull
            Requests are designed to encourage and capture this type of
            conversation.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can also continue to push to your branch in light of discussion
            and feedback about your commits. If someone comments that you forgot
            to do something or if there is a bug in the code, you can fix it in
            your branch and push up the change. GitHub will show your new
            commits and any additional feedback you may receive in the unified
            Pull Request view.
          </p>

          <h3>ProTip</h3>

          <p>
            Pull Request comments are written in Markdown, so you can embed
            images and emoji, use pre-formatted text blocks, and other
            lightweight formatting.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div
          class="panel-content js-panel-content js-panel-content-deploy"
          data-step="deploy"
        >
          <h2>Deploy</h2>

          <p>
            With GitHub, you can deploy from a branch for final testing in
            production before merging to main.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once your pull request has been reviewed and the branch passes your
            tests, you can deploy your changes to verify them in production. If
            your branch causes issues, you can roll it back by deploying the
            existing main branch into production.
          </p>

          <p>
            Different teams may have different deployment strategies. For some,
            it may be best to deploy to a specially provisioned testing
            environment. For others, deploying directly to production may be the
            better choice based on the other elements in their workflow.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div
          class="panel-content js-panel-content js-panel-content-merge"
          data-step="merge"
        >
          <h2>Merge</h2>

          <p>
            Now that your changes have been verified in production, it is time
            to merge your code into the main branch.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once merged, Pull Requests preserve a record of the historical
            changes to your code. Because they're searchable, they let anyone go
            back in time to understand why and how a decision was made.
          </p>

          <h3>ProTip</h3>

          <p>
            By incorporating certain keywords into the text of your Pull
            Request, you can associate issues with code. When your Pull Request
            is merged, the related issues are also closed. For example, entering
            the phrase
            <code>Closes #32</code> would close issue number 32 in the
            repository. For more information, check out our
